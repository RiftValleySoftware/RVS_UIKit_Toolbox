# ``RVS_UIKit_Toolbox``

A set of basic [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) tools, for Swift iOS app development.

## Overview

This package offers a few extensions of standard UIKit classes, in order to abstract some of the more common sftware tasks.

## Implementation

### Where to Get

- [The project is available at this GitHub repo](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox)
- [Here is the technical documentation](https://riftvalleysoftware.github.io/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox/)

#### Swift Package Manager

The most common method of integration will almost certainly be via [the Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).

The package can be accessed from [GitHub](https://github.com), via the following URIs:

- SSL: git@github.com:RiftValleySoftware/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox.git
- HTTPS: https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox.git

Simply integrate the package into your project, and import the module, in files that use its extensions:

    import RVS_UIKit_Toolbox

#### Carthage

You can also get the package, using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), the general-purpose package manager that is supplied by GitHub.

In order to import the package, add the following line to your [cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

    github "RiftValleySoftware/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox"

If you choose to build the module, you will also need to import the module into files that use the extensions:

    import RVS_UIKit_Toolbox
    
Alternatively, the entire set of extensions is available in [a single source file](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox.swift), that you can integrate directly into the main module:

With Carthage, this would be available in the `Carthage/Checkins/RVS_UIKit_ToolboxSources/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox` directory.

If you do this, then the file would be integrated directly into the main module, so you will not need to `import` the file.

#### Git Submodule

Finally, you can simply include the module into your project, using [a Git Submodule](), which is available, using the two URIs (SSL or HTTPS), referenced above, in Swift Package Manager section.

If you do this, you should include the source file directly into your project, as outlined in the Carthage section.

### How to Use

Once the package has been added to the project, and the module is imported (or the source file is directly integrated into the main module), the extensions immediately become available in the base UIKit classes. The extensions are listed below:

#### [UITabBarController](https://riftvalleysoftware.github.io/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox/Extensions/UITabBarController.html)

This adds just one method to [the standard UIKit UITabBarController Class](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitabbarcontroller):

- [`setColorsTo(normal: UIColor?, selected: UIColor?, background: UIColor?)`](https://riftvalleysoftware.github.io/RVS_UIKit_Toolbox/Extensions/UITabBarController.html#/s:So18UITabBarControllerC17RVS_UIKit_ToolboxE11setColorsTo6normal8selected10backgroundySo7UIColorCSg_A2JtF)

The purpose of this method, is to allow an easy shortcut to customizing the colors of the Tab Bar.
